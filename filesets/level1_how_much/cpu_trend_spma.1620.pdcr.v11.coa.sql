DBC Option (uses PDCRINFO.ResusageSpma_hst)
Version 11 (2019-05-07)
Parameters:
  resusagespma    = {resusagespma}
  siteid          = {siteid}
  startdate       = {startdate}
  enddate         = {enddate}

Stage Table:  {db_stg}.stg_dat_level1_CPU_Forecast

Target Table: {db_coa}.coat_dat_level1_CPU_Forecast


CPU Utilization 4-Hour Variable Peak from ResusageSpma (Viewpoint CPU Utilization Method).
•	Evaluates the percentage of time CPU’s in the collection period that CPU’s were busy processing requests (CPUUServ + CPUUExec ??CPUNice??
•	AvgCPUBusyPct is an average of CPU utilization across the entire system. The premise is that when CPU’s reach 80% busy (i.e., reserve capacity level) the system will likely suffer performance impact.
•	Evaluates 365 days of history (weekdays only) and the busiest 4-hours of each day (whenever they occur).  Peak periods are contiguous 4-hour periods (not individual hours) and may vary (PeakStart & PeakEnd displayed in result) depending on utilization.
•	Peak periods may start on one day and end in the next – peak periods are always recorded on the day in which they end.
•	Simple linear regression is used to determine trend line with slope & intercept.
•	The slope of the trend line is used to extend anticipated usage 365 days into the future or when utilization is forecasted to exceed 100% (whichever comes first).
•	21 day Moving Average is included to emphasize recent activity in addition to the longer trend (typically 21 business days in a calendar month).
•	Reserve Capacity is set at 80% (workload performance will likely be impacted when CPU’s exceed 80% utilization).
•	Reserve Horizon represents the (future) point in time at which utilization is expected to exceed 80%.
•	Slope is the daily percentage increase/decrease in utilization of the trend line (positive = increasing utilization, negative = decreasing utilization).
•	SQL uses UNION to combine historical trend with future forecast – identical changes typically must be made to both SQL statements in UNION.
•
Execution Instructions
•	Copy/Paste below query into favorite query tool & execute.
•	Copy/Paste result set from query tool into Excel and save as .xls or .xlsx
o	Don’t export results (impacts formatting).
o	Don’t save results to spreadsheeting (impacts formatting).
•	Use visualization tool to import results for analysis (coming soon).

Using the results to drive customer discussions
•	Trending up or down? What is the growth rate (monthly change in percent utilization)?
•	How long before trend hits 80% (reserve horizon) and 100% maximum?
•	What happens when actual utilization hits the reserve amount (~80%)
o	Performance becomes more variable as more requests compete for limited resources
o	Delay queue gets longer, and response time increases for the same type of requests
o	Tactical queries may miss SLA’s without proper workload management rules
o	Customer submits more Performance P1’s – “queries are slow – my system is broken!”
•	Teradata can help address the risk of not having enough resources to meet workload demand
o	Release COD or system expansion
o	Is there enough time for performance optimization (probably requires 3 to 6 month runway).


Hard-Coded parameters
Changes can be made by modifying the SQL below (change the yellow highlighted values):
(2) Reserve Capacity – default is 80% of utilization (only one change required)
,80 AS ReserveX
(3) Variable Peak Length (N+1) in hours (value 3 = 4 hours) – two changes required
,AVG(HourlyAvgIOPct) OVER (ORDER BY  SiteID, TheDate ,TheHour ROWS 3 PRECEDING) AS VPeakAvgIOPct
(5) Future forecast - number of days into the future for extended trend line – two changes required.
WHERE  c2.calendar_date BETWEEN a5.TheDate+1 AND a5.TheDate + 365
